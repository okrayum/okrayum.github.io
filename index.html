        <p>
          It's unfortunate, but animals sometimes get hit by cars, especially in
          high-traffic areas. When this happens, there are often hidden risks.
          These situations can attract diseases, pests, or other
          animalsâ€”potentially leading to further accidents. Leaving the animal
          on the road not only poses hazards but also reflects poor care for the
          animal.

        <p>
          We've made it simple to report an animal that needs to be picked up.
          You have options:
        </p>

        <ol class="choices">
          <li>
            Call our toll-free number: <strong>1-888-555-5555</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Leave a message with the address and location.</li>
              <li>Provide the type of animal and a brief description.</li>
              <li>
                Mention if the animal is in the middle or side of the road.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Use the reporting form and map:
            <ul>
              <li>
                Submit a report form with as much detail as
                possible.
              </li>
              <li>
                Upon form submission, a marker will be placed on the map to mark
                the pickup site, and our team will be notified.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ol>
