      <p>
        It's a sad occurrence but animals often do get hit by cars, especially
        in high traffic areas. When this happens, there are often unseen
        hazards. The animal may attract disease and pests to your area, it may
        draw other animals that may also be in danger of traffic, also if just
        left in the street, that is poor treatment of the animal.
      </p>

      <p>
        We make it real simple to report the location of an animal needing to be
        picked up. You have 3 choices:
      </p>

      <ul class="choices">
        <li>
          Call out toll free number 1-888-888-5555 and leave a message with the
          adress and location, the type of animal, a brief description and if
          located in the street please mention if the middle or side of the
          road.
        </li>
        <li>
          Use the reporting form on the next page and provide the listed
          information as detailed ass possible.
        </li>
        <li>
          Use the map option to select the area where the animal is and drop a
          pin. Then select the description from the choices available and
          submit.
        </li>
      </ul>
