          It's unfortunate, but animals sometimes get hit by cars, especially in
          high-traffic areas. When this happens, there are often hidden risks.
          These situations can attract diseases, pests, or other
          animalsâ€”potentially leading to further accidents. Leaving the animal
          on the road not only poses hazards but also reflects poor care for the
          animal.

          <h2>How to Report a Roadside Animal</h2>
          <p>
            We've made it simple to report an animal that needs to be picked up.
            You have options:
          </p>

          <ol class="choices">
            <li>
              Call our toll-free number: <strong>1-888-555-5555</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>Leave a message with the address and location.</li>
                <li>Provide the type of animal and a brief description.</li>
                <li>
                  Mention if the animal is in the middle or side of the road.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Use the reporting form or map:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Fill out the form on the next page with as much detail as
                  possible.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Or, use the map to drop a pin on the animal's location and
                  select a description from the available options.
                </li>
              </ul>
