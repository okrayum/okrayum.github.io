          It's a sad occurrence but animals often do get hit by cars, especially
          in high traffic areas. When this happens, there are often unseen
          hazards. The animal may attract disease and pests to your area, it may
          draw other animals that may also be in danger of traffic, also if just
          left in the street, that is poor treatment of the animal.
