# Animal Report App

The **Animal Report App** is a proof-of-concept tool aimed at simplifying the process of reporting city issues that require intervention, starting with deceased animal pick-up. The app allows users to submit reports, view them on a map, and track progress. It is designed to help city services respond quickly and efficiently.

## Live Demo

### How It Works

The app simplifies the reporting process by allowing users to:

- Fill out a form to provide detailed information about the issue.
- See the reported location marked on a map for easy reference.
- View a list of open reports for transparency and follow-up.

Currently, the app focuses on reporting deceased animals needing pick-up on city property. Future plans include expanding the app to report other city maintenance issues, such as potholes, broken streetlights, and abandoned vehicles.

## Future Enhancements

The goal of the **Animal Report App** is to make the reporting process even more seamless. Planned updates include:

- Allowing users to place markers directly on the map to specify locations.
- Adding features to report various city maintenance needs in a single app.
- Collaborating with city departments to ensure reports are routed efficiently to the appropriate teams.

By making reporting easier, we hope to improve city upkeep and contribute to safer, cleaner communities.
