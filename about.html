        <p>
          The Animal Report App was created to address a common problem in urban
          environments: the challenge of reporting issues that require city
          intervention. Our mission is to provide residents with an easy-to-use
          tool to ensure city services can address issues quickly and
          effectively.

        <h2 id="how-it-works-heading">How It Works</h2>
        <p>This app simplifies the reporting process by allowing users to:</p>
        <ul class="info-list">
          <li>
            Fill out a form to provide detailed information about the issue.
          </li>
          <li>
            See the reported location marked on a Google Map for easy reference.
          </li>
          <li>View a list of open reports for transparency and follow-up.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Currently, we focus on reporting deceased animals needing pick-up on
          city property, but future plans include expanding the app to report
          potholes, broken streetlights, abandoned vehicles, and more.

        <h2 id="future-plans-heading">Future Enhancements</h2>
        <p>
          Our goal is to make the reporting process even more seamless. Planned
          updates include:
        </p>
        <ul class="info-list">
          <li>
            Allowing users to place markers directly on the map to specify
            locations.
          </li>
          <li>
            Adding features for reporting various city maintenance needs in a
            single app.
          </li>
          <li>
            Collaborating with city departments to ensure reports are routed
            efficiently to the appropriate teams.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          By making reporting easier, we hope to improve city upkeep and
          contribute to safer, cleaner communities.
